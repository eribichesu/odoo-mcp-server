# ChatGPT Desktop - Odoo MCP Server Configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**ChatGPT Desktop currently supports MCP integration through remote connections only**

According to the [official MCP client documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients), ChatGPT Desktop supports:
- ‚úÖ **Tools** (via remote MCP servers)
- ‚ùå Resources, Prompts, Sampling, Roots, Notifications (not supported)

**This means local MCP servers (like our Odoo MCP server) cannot be directly configured in ChatGPT Desktop.**

## üîå Alternative Integration Options

Since ChatGPT Desktop only supports remote MCP servers, here are your options:

### Option 1: Deploy as Remote MCP Server

To use your Odoo MCP server with ChatGPT Desktop, you need to deploy it as a remote server accessible over HTTP/SSE (Server-Sent Events).

**Currently, this requires additional implementation work** as your local server needs to be converted to support SSE transport.

### Option 2: Use Alternative MCP Clients

Instead of ChatGPT Desktop, consider these MCP clients that support local servers:

- **Claude Desktop App** - Full local MCP support (resources, prompts, tools)
- **VS Code GitHub Copilot** - Full MCP support with stdio and SSE
- **Continue** (VS Code extension) - Built-in MCP support for all features
- **Cursor** - AI code editor with MCP tools support
- **LM Studio** - Local models with MCP integration

### Option 3: Future ChatGPT Desktop Integration

Monitor the [MCP client documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for updates on ChatGPT Desktop's local server support.

## üìö What Was Originally Configured

The files created in this guide were based on the assumption that ChatGPT Desktop supported local MCP servers like Claude Desktop does. While these files are not usable with ChatGPT Desktop, they can serve as templates for:

### üìã Configuration Options

ChatGPT Desktop typically uses one of these approaches for MCP server integration:

#### Option 1: Direct Extension Configuration

Create a configuration file for ChatGPT Desktop:

**File:** `~/.config/chatgpt-desktop/mcp-config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "odoo": {
      "command": "/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp/src/odoo_mcp/server.py"],
      "cwd": "/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Extension Manifest

Create an extension manifest file:

**File:** `odoo-mcp-extension.json`

```json
{
  "name": "Odoo MCP Server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "MCP server for Odoo integration - CRUD operations, model introspection, and reporting",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "mcp": {
    "server": {
      "command": "/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp/src/odoo_mcp/server.py"],
      "cwd": "/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/edoardo.ribichesu/vscode/odoo.mcp/src"
      }
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "check_odoo_connection",
        "description": "Check connection to Odoo server"
      },
      {
        "name": "search_odoo_records", 
        "description": "Search for records in Odoo models"
      },
      {
        "name": "create_odoo_record",
        "description": "Create new records in Odoo"
      },
      {
        "name": "update_odoo_record",
        "description": "Update existing Odoo records"
      },
      {
        "name": "delete_odoo_record", 
        "description": "Delete records from Odoo"
      },
      {
        "name": "get_odoo_model_fields",
        "description": "Get field definitions for Odoo models"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Check ChatGPT Desktop MCP Support**
   - Open ChatGPT Desktop settings
   - Look for "Extensions", "Plugins", or "MCP Servers" section
   - Note the configuration method used

2. **Create Configuration Directory** (if needed)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/chatgpt-desktop
   ```

3. **Copy Configuration File**
   ```bash
   cp odoo-mcp-chatgpt-config.json ~/.config/chatgpt-desktop/mcp-config.json
   ```

4. **Restart ChatGPT Desktop**

5. **Test Connection**
   - Ask: "What MCP tools are available?"
   - Ask: "Check my Odoo connection"
   - Ask: "Search for customers in Odoo"

### üîß Alternative: Standalone MCP Extension

If ChatGPT Desktop doesn't have built-in MCP support, you can create a bridge extension:

**File:** `chatgpt-odoo-bridge.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Bridge extension for ChatGPT Desktop to connect to Odoo MCP server.
"""

import asyncio
import json
import subprocess
from typing import Dict, Any

class ChatGPTOdooBridge:
    def __init__(self):
## üìã Summary

Based on the current MCP client support matrix:

- **ChatGPT Desktop**: Only supports remote MCP servers (not local ones like ours)
- **Recommended alternatives**: Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Continue, Cursor, or LM Studio
- **Future possibility**: ChatGPT Desktop may add local server support in the future

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **For immediate use**: Set up your Odoo MCP server with Claude Desktop or VS Code Copilot
2. **For ChatGPT integration**: Wait for remote server support or deploy to a remote server
3. **Keep monitoring**: Check the [MCP clients page](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for updates

## üìû Need Help?

If you'd like to use your Odoo MCP server with a supported client or need help deploying it as a remote server, let me know!

Your Odoo MCP server is ready and can be used with any MCP client that supports local servers.
